# Scraping
1. In the 'albums' collect of the MongoDB do not use the 'user_urls' field.
   BC hides the user lists as an anti-bot measure when requests occur too
   frequently.

# Model Building
1. There are three routes to take:
     Factorization Recommender w/ TF-IDF (use subjectivity)
        Implement and test using sample albums
     Item Similarity Recommender (use Precision 10 as metric)
        Run grid search on this model
     Factorization Recommender w/ Binary Targets (use Precision 10 as metric)
        Run this model more times

# Web App
1. Album art URLs are of form 'https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a<'item_art_id'>_9.jpg'
