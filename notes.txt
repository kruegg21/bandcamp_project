# Scraping
1. In the 'albums' collect of the MongoDB do not use the 'user_urls' field.
   BC hides the user lists as an anti-bot measure when requests occur too
   frequently.

# Model Building
1. There are three routes to take:
     Factorization Recommender w/ TF-IDF (use subjectivity)
        Implement and test using sample albums
     Item Similarity Recommender (use Precision 10 as metric)
        Run grid search on this model
     Factorization Recommender w/ Binary Targets (use Precision 10 as metric)
        Run this model more times

# Web App
1. Album art URLs are of form 'https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a<'item_art_id'>_9.jpg'

# Validation
1. We are forced to choose between two imperfect methods. First is the
   'swiss cheese matrix' method and the second si the 'all cold start' method.

# Serendipity
1. Change ratings to be 1 + S * (IDF)
      S -- serendipity parameters
      IDF -- log inverse document frequency
2. Get raw probabilities from the factorization model and use these scores as
   the probability of recommendation
